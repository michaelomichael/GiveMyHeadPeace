# Privacy Policy for GiveMyHeadPeace

Effective Date: 14th January 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data and your personal 
information when you use the GiveMyHeadPeace (the "Extension").

## Data Collection and Usage
The Extension does not collect, store, track, or transmit any data from your 
browser, including the content of the webpages you visit. All operations 
performed by the Extension, including changes to the webpage's DOM 
(Document Object Model), occur locally on your device.

## Permissions
The Extension may require certain permissions to function properly, such 
as access to webpage content, but this access is strictly limited to 
making necessary changes to the DOM as per its intended functionality. 
No data is transmitted to external servers, third parties, or stored 
beyond your browser session.

## Third-Party Services
The Extension does not integrate with or use any third-party analytics, 
tracking tools, or advertising networks.

## Security
Because the Extension does not process or transmit any user data, risks 
related to data breaches or unauthorized data access are minimized. 
However, we recommend keeping your browser and extensions updated to 
ensure security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy
The author may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect 
updates or changes to the Extension. Any updates will be reflected in 
the Effective Date above.
